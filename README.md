# Bank-DBMS Application/Project   

-> Developed by Shreyansh Padarha
*Description*  

This is a repository that consists of a project i created for my first semester college finals. It's a Tkinter GUI library based application, where a user can create a bank account and it'll get deposited in the database. The user can then, deposit, withdraw money, and edit his/her account.  The application also has a normal calculator, simple interest calculator and a compound interest calculator.  


+ Disclaimer : This is the first project i ever created, thus the code is not properly optimized and has some minor bugs, but for a beginner, there is enough visualization and content to understand, how i created this project in 6-7 days.

1. Code File --> main.py (main code), png, icon, database file
