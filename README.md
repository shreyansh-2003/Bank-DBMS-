# Bank-DBMS Application/Project   

## Description 
This repostiry is a project, for a sample bank dbms system. It tries to incoporate some prevalent financial features.
The main applicatioon is based on a Tkinter (Python Library) GUI, where a user can create a bank account and it'll get deposited in the database. The user can then, deposit, withdraw money, and edit his/her account.  The application also has a normal calculator, simple interest calculator and a compound interest calculator.  

__Note:__  This is the first project i ever created on python for my Introduction to Python Paper, within a 7 day timeframe, thus the code is not properly optimized and has some minor bugs, but for a beginner.

## Repository Structure 

1. **Code File** --> ```main.py``` (main code), png, icon, database file
2. **Idea write up and report pdf** --> This tells the idea behind creating the project and what approach i had in mind. It also highlights the challenges i faced and the scope of improvement
3. **Running Screenshots | Output pdf** --> Compilation of all running screenshots of the application 
4. **Application Presentation** --> Highlights the process and output achieved in a ppt format
